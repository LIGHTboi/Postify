    What an incredible experience at SpaceCon 2024 at NSUT! ðŸš€
    
    Over the last 48 hours, my teamâ€”Gunjan, Aakash, Aarushi, and Iâ€”pushed our limits, brainstormed innovative solutions, and built something truly exciting. The best part? We made it to the finals! ðŸŽ‰
    
    The journey was filled with sleepless nights, debugging marathons, and last-minute pivots, but every moment was worth it. Collaborating with such a talented team reminded me how important teamwork, resilience, and creative problem-solving are in tech.
